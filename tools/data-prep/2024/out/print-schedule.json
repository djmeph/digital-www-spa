Combusting the toxic energy around malignant physical & Emotional imprints. Scours clean the imprints in the LEF. Transforms heavy emotions associated with trauma & disease into nourishing life energy."

This workshop is great for anyone who suffers from chronic pain, muscle tension and anxiety to name a few. This is also helpful if you have a movement practice of your own (like dance or flow) that you want to improve with tension release to increase mobility. The instructor, Big Kris (Kris Smith) is a functional fitness expert with CPT certification for 10 years, with 6 years experience teaching somatic movement."

    "evt_description": "This workshop aims to help individuals bodied with a penis bring more mindfulness and develop a deeper sense of pleasure in their self-pleasure practice. After an opening discussion where we will address what to expect and consent, we'll go through a series of breathwork, light stretching and movement, identifying the erotic anatomy of the penis and the body, edging techniques, and conscious ejaculation. Our masturbation practice can be synchronous with how we show up and enjoy playtime with our partners. While this workshop will be helpful to all individuals bodied with a penis, the skills and techniques taught will also aid those who might experience premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, or delayed erections. To keep the container safe and accessible to all gender and sexual identities, this is strictly a solo self-pleasure workshop. After the workshop, we will close with a small group discussion where participants can share their experiences if they feel comfortable, or ask questions. "

The art form likely began as a way to illustrate stories during religious ceremonies or entertain audiences in various cultural rituals, eventually evolving into a captivating form of visual storytelling. The goal of Umbra, Penumbra is to offer the puppeteer an opportunity to explore and reflect upon the dichotomy between light and dark in collaboration and community with others, rather than in isolation."

The Shamanic Drum: The shamanic drum is an essential tool for connecting with spiritual entities and the divine. It creates a rhythmic vibration that induces altered states of consciousness. Through drumming, shamans can journey beyond their physical bodies and explore other realms. Rhythm and Trance: Shamanic drumming uses a simple, repetitive rhythm that typically ranges from 200 to 400 beats per minute. As you listen to these beats, your brain enters a state conducive to healing and vision work. The drumming serves as a gateway to accessing innate wisdom and guidance."

This session is beginner friendly with all materials provided. Just come with a willingness to engage in playful darkness, make things up and improvise a bit, and roll some dice. Content will be somewhat dark, but we can collectively set the tone somewhere between \"PG-13\" and \"R\", and will also be using \"safety tools\" to ensure comfort with subject matter. Note also that the Doom Room has low lighting, and that we will be playing atmospheric metal music (at a lowish volume) throughout the event."

Subverting conventional aesthetic notions by leaning into tension and dissonance, Butoh taps into the subconscious to unearth raw emotions and recover the primal body. In this workshop, we'll peel back layers of socialization and unravel the guts of what it means to be human through embodied exploration and movement via guided imagery and introspective suggestions, bringing awareness and acceptance to the uncomfortable messes we'd much rather sweep under the rug. For those looking to slow the f**k down and deepen their somatic perceptivity, nervous system capacity, attention to detail, patience, curiosity, and sense of wonder; look no further! No former experience with this practice is necessary, but arrive sober with your feels, an open mind, and a willingness to embrace the darkness and let it move you. Come dressed in clothing/footwear comfortable for movement on the beach, prepared to interact with the elements, as we will migrate to (and, optionally, into) the lake during the workshop. A towel, sunscreen, and hydration / a snack would also be advised. "

Then you'll be guided through several gentle movements to sense their impact your body's ability to notice and release tension. This multi- day workshop could be a great one- off, or you could return the following day to delve deeper into the practice. The whole session will take 45 min- 1 hour. This workshop is great for anyone who suffers from chronic pain, muscle tension and anxiety to name a few. This is also helpful if you have a movement practice of your own (like dance or flow) that you want to improve with tension release to increase mobility. The instructor, Big Kris (Kris Smith) is a functional fitness expert with CPT certification for 10 years, with 6 years experience teaching somatic movement."

It's a battle royale where the goal is simple - be the last one standing with the fishnet's waistband still clinging on for dear life! It's a no-holds-barred competition where participants will do whatever it takes to rip off their opponents' fishnets while keeping their own assets firmly covered. We've got referees on deck with loud whistles making sure the action stays raunchy, rowdy, and utterly unforgettable. ️ Don't miss your chance to witness the wildest, most tantalizing fishnet wrestling showdown Friday at 4 at the effigy. Fishnets provided (while supplies last) or bring your own to join in on the fun. Additional clothing optional. We are not responsible for any injuries or death that may occur but we will clean up the fishnet mess. "

The Shamanic Drum: The shamanic drum is an essential tool for connecting with spiritual entities and the divine. It creates a rhythmic vibration that induces altered states of consciousness. Through drumming, shamans can journey beyond their physical bodies and explore other realms. Rhythm and Trance: Shamanic drumming uses a simple, repetitive rhythm that typically ranges from 200 to 400 beats per minute. As you listen to these beats, your brain enters a state conducive to healing and vision work. The drumming serves as a gateway to accessing innate wisdom and guidance."

Combusting the toxic energy around malignant physical & Emotional imprints. Scours clean the imprints in the LEF.
