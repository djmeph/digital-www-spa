In this workshop, we'll peel back layers of socialization and unravel the guts of what it means to be human through embodied exploration and movement via guided imagery and introspective suggestions, bringing awareness and acceptance to the uncomfortable messes we'd much rather sweep under the rug. For those looking to slow the f**k down and deepen their somatic perceptivity, nervous system capacity, attention to detail, patience, curiosity, and sense of wonder; look no further! No former experience with this practice is necessary, but arrive sober with your feels, an open mind, and a willingness to embrace the darkness and let it move you. Come dressed in clothing/footwear comfortable for movement on the beach, prepared to interact with the elements, as we will migrate to (and, optionally, into) the lake during the workshop. A towel, sunscreen, and hydration / a snack would also be advised. ",

Our masturbation practice can be synchronous with how we show up and enjoy playtime with our partners. While this workshop will be helpful to all individuals bodied with a penis, the skills and techniques taught will also aid those who might experience premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, or delayed erections. To keep the container safe and accessible to all gender and sexual identities, this is strictly a solo self-pleasure workshop. After the workshop, we will close with a small group discussion where participants can share their experiences if they feel comfortable, or ask questions. ",
